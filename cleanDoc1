growth utilities business‐to‐business b2b service providers consider potential systemic risks fintechs regulators incumbents implications incumbents incumbents need differentiate customer‐facing processes middle back offices become commoditized context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings profit redistribution technology new partnerships enable organizations bypass traditional value chains thereby redistributing profit pools location profit pools within value chains shift technological catalysts enable companies change positions relationships archetypes intra‐value chain disruption inter‐value chain shifts technological value bridge existing value chain participants bypassing traditional intermediaries seeking partnerships directly customer‐facing start‐ups thereby becoming direct competitors past partners technology allowing consumers easily switch products different value chains migrating profit pools new organizations new technologies simplify connections within large complicated networks making companies focused connecting participants vulnerable disruption example munich large reinsurer partnering product start‐ups including bought many trōv directly compete traditional insurance partners example investment firms vanguard betterment started proposing exchange‐traded funds etfs alternative savings accounts shifting customers bank deposits example

potential pressures/shifts partners implications incumbents intermediaries derive value position value chain struggle profitable scale necessary survival context approach key findings key

controlling product manufacturing distribution allowing product distributors leverage control customer experience place pressure manufacturers archetypes brand opportunity product curation control

manufacturers share liability far‐reaching consequences incumbents implications incumbents incumbents advantages race become distributors due existing customer base however incumbents fail become product distributors see decline product profit margins due cost commoditization context approach key findings key uncertainties key findings platforms rising platforms offer ability engage different

secure data creating new business line fintechs implications financial institutions data security crucial establishing maintaining trust customer new partnerships based data create imperative company‐ wide partnership strategy national data regulators play larger role financial services fintechs regulators incumbents implications regulators regulators must carefully monitor sharing data ensure risk hacking low possible regulators must also aware banks use additional data collect whether customers understand impact sharing information regulators must decide much consumers control information
